# Project 3 - *Parstagram*
Android App using Kotlin

## Part 2

**Parstagram** is a photo sharing app similar to Instagram but using Parse as its backend.

Time spent: **12** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [x] User can view the last 20 posts submitted to "Instagram".

- [x] User can comment on a post and see all comments for each post in the post details screen.
- [x] User can like a post and see number of likes for each post in the post details screen.

## Notes

This part was harder than the first part because there was a lot of new features to implement like figuring out how to work with fragments and ParseObjects.
